Bagels, a deductive logic game.
By Al Sweigart al@inventwithpython.com
I am thinking of a 3-digit number. Try to guess what it is.
Here are some clues:
When I say:    That means:
  Pico         One digit is correct but in the wrong position.
  Fermi        One digit is correct and in the right position.
  Bagels       No digit is correct.
I have thought up a number.
 You have 10 guesses to get it.
